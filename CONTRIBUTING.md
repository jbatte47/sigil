# Contributing to Sigil

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Sigil**, a language that bridges the magical and the mechanical.

This project is built on equal parts compiler theory, narrative design, and metaphysical speculation. If you’re here, you probably care about at least one of those—so you’re in the right place.

## 🧱 Project Goals

- Build a real compiler and runtime for the fictional programming language *Sigil*
- Maintain a clean separation between narrative IP and open-source tooling
- Foster a respectful and creative space for developers, storytellers, and language nerds

## 🛠️ Where You Can Help

**Grammar / Compiler**
- Help define and refine the `BNF` grammar
- Adhere to the [Canonical Call Syntax Policy](docs/SYNTAX_POLICY.md)
- Implement core parsing and evaluation behavior using Flex/Bison
- Expand the type checker and decorator system

**Runtime / CLI**
- Improve the REPL experience
- Format output reports with templated clarity
- Add vessel-related runtime mechanics

**Examples & Testing**
- Write `.sigil` scripts that demonstrate language features
- Help build a canonical standard library of spell logic
- Create end-to-end test cases that validate expected output
