# 🪄 Sigil

**Sigil** is a fictional programming language embedded within a narrative universe—but also a real-world, executable DSL with a ritual-based programming model and a diegetic narrative engine.

In the world of the story, Sigil scripts alter physical reality through performed incantations. This toolchain makes that system technically coherent and executable—bridging narrative design, compiler theory, and atmospheric world-building.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Expression-First**: Sigil is a functional DSL. Every operation—arithmetic, ritual calls, and essence invocations—is an expression.
- **Hierarchical Namespaces**: Core reality-shards are accessed via dot-notation (e.g., `Essence.heat`, `Action.long_press`, `World.ping`).
- **Implicit Currying**: All rituals and built-in functions support partial application. Calling a function with subset arguments returns a curried function for later use.
- **Instance Decoration**: Type and instance metadata are part of the language roadmap, with v2 documentation and examples converging on declarative forms.
- **Diegetic Runtime**: Instead of technical logs, the toolchain emits atmospheric, MUD-style narrative descriptions to `STDOUT`.

## ⚙️ The Toolchain

Sigil uses a classical compiler pipeline tailored for narrative output:
- **Lexer/Parser**: Flex + Bison (Handling indentation, hierarchical namespaces, and recursive expressions).
- **Semantic Validator**: Enforces "Reality Interfaces" (e.g., `Combustible`, `Staff`) and tracks port compatibility.
- **Narrative Engine**: Translates AST nodes into diegetic prose via a spatial lexicon.

### Building
```bash
cd compiler
make
```

### Running
```bash
./sigil_compiler ../examples/fireball_staff.sigil
```

## 📜 Example Ritual: `fireball_staff.sigil`

```sigil
core manifests [ Factor, Type, Distance, Func, Vector3 ]
reality manifests [ Combustible, Enemy, WorldObject, Shape ]
paranormal manifests [ Essence, Psychic ]

incant target_enemy [type:Type, radius:Distance]
  (Psychic.ping (actual radius))
  | (Func.filter (join type Enemy))
  | (Func.first)

incant fireball [target:WorldObject, intensity:Factor]
  (hold [actual_intensity as (actual intensity)])
  | (Essence.heat actual_intensity)
  | (Shape.sphere (/ actual_intensity 2))
  | (Vector3.straight target)
  | (Essence.force (* actual_intensity 2))
```

Canonical v2 examples also live under `examples/v2/`.

## 🎭 Diegetic Output

When executed, Sigil produces a "Reality Manifest":

```text
--- AREA DESCRIPTION ---
The chamber is silent, smelled of ozone and ancient wood.

Resting here is ash_staff, an expertly carved focal point.
Resting here is goblin, a looming threat, clad in rags.

You begin to weave patterns into the ash_staff, binding its form to your will.
A faint glow emerges as shimmering waves of intense heat begins to flow...

You perform a focused gesture with the ash_staff.
A searing bolt of arcane energy erupts from the staff's tip!
The goblins are caught in the shimmering heat and sent tumbling backward by the crushing wall of kinetic pressure.
--- END OF LOG ---
```
