   - You may build tooling that interacts with the Sigil compiler or grammar, 
     provided such tooling does not replicate or reinterpret Sigil’s fictional 
     language as part of a separate creative or narrative work.

3. Prohibited Use
   - You may not use Sigil’s syntax, structure, concepts, or example spells 
     in books, games, comics, ARGs, or other fictional works without explicit 
     written permission.
   - You may not represent the Sigil language or universe as your own creation.
   - You may not commercialize derived content that uses or implies canonical 
     Sigil structure.

4. Exceptions
   Exceptions may be granted for educational, scholarly, or research use. 
   Please contact the author to request permission.

5. Enforcement
   Unauthorized use of Sigil’s fictional elements constitutes copyright
